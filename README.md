# Home-Automation
I made a Google Voice Assistant-based smart home automation project to control the appliances of my house. For this project, I used the NodeMCU development board, 5V relay module, and some connecting wires. For the IoT cloud, I used Blynk to control my relay module from my mobile phone. I have used a Nodemcu development board in order to connect my circuit to the Internet. The relay module is used as a switch to turn on the LED bulb whenever its pin gets high by Google Assistant. In order to power it, I have used the Arduino UNO board. To communicate with the Google assistant on my smartphone, I have used a 3rd party service, which configures the assistant to listen for a particular command and trigger a link if the command is received. Using the voice commands on google assistant, “Ok Google, turn on the lights”, I was able to control lights as well as other appliances of my house.
